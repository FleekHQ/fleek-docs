This decentralized app demonstrates how Fleek Storage can be leveraged to store the assets of ERC-721 NFTs on IPFS. The dapp mints new tokens with an IPFS hash of an image stored on the smart contract itself.

It was made using the AWS S3-based SDK of Fleek Storage, but it is recommended to use Fleek Storage Js for newer apps.
