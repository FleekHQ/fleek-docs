*Update (08/31/23): This doc has been updated to better reflect the state of the road to sunsetting, and to include the Alpha release. After the release of V1, this doc won’t be updated further.*

At the end of last year (2022), we brought many updates to the world of Fleek. Among those updates, our plan to build a new Fleek (fleek.xyz) with a new fully event-based architecture, fully modular, and extensible. A new foundation upon which Fleek could grow to offer any folder of infrastructure and development services, out of the constraints of the current platform.

Once the platform is live, we will begin the sunsetting of Fleek.co, and full migration to the new improved platform.

## Phases

To be more organized we are separating the road towards sunsetting the old platform in different sequential phases that help us to ensure that the migration is up to our standards and every user has a fantastic experience leading into the new platform.

### CLI/SDK Test Phase (Completed)

In this stage, users can interact in a very limited capacity with our SDK and CLI, to store files in IPFS, deploy their sites, and configure custom domains on top of it.

### Alpha release of the App/platform (Current)

The next phase involves releasing the alpha new platform, which will allow us to test the new UI, and to show the capabilities of the platform in a closed environment. During this phase, we will be collecting feedback actively and setting the groundwork for customer support moving forward.

- Visit https://fleek.xyz/ to test the alpha.
- [Read this FAQ](https://blog.fleek.xyz/post/fleekco-users-and-alpha-fleekxyz/) regarding testing the app as a fleek.co user.

While we test the stability of the platform, collect feedback, and optimize the UI flows, we will be focusing on finishing the features that are needed to achieve feature parity between Fleek.co & Fleek.xyz.

Additionally, in this period we will develop the migration flow for users.

### Release Fleek Platform V1

Once all of the above is achieved we will be releasing to the public what we will know as Fleek Platform V1, the first stable version that will run in parallel with the old platform. At this phase, we will be stopping signups on Fleek.co and offering all the user's migration tools to request to move all their relevant data to Fleek.xyz. This phase is aimed at September.

### Sunsetting of Fleek.co

After a prudent time of co-existence between the platforms and when the goals of these processes are met we will be shutting down Fleek.co and automatically migrate the missing users that didn't request it.

As we move closer to the finish line we will be sharing more information about the stages, timings and how migration details will be, so stay tuned!

### FAQ:

**Q: Can I keep building on Fleek.co, or should I wait for v1 of Fleek.xyz?**

Users can feel comfortable continuing to work and build on Fleek.co. You can continue to start and grow your project on the legacy platform, and migrate over to the new platform starting from V1, when all migration tools are ready and feature parity is achieved. The process will be seamless, so no disruptions would occur to projects.

**Q: Will I have a different account or lose progress/projects?**

Yes and no. While the new platform will need you to create a new account, the new Fleek is a direct replacement of the old Fleek, so all users, their projects, sites, and storage, and accounts will be able to migrate over fully.

**Q: Will Fleek.co stop its services?**

Yes, but not now and not in the short-term future. Once V1 of the new platform releases, people won’t be able to create new accounts to Fleek.co. However, existing users will be able to use the legacy service and choose to migrate over for an extended period of time. Only then we will flip the switch.
