![](imgs/sunset.jpg)

At the end of last year (2022), we brought many updates to the world of Fleek. Among those updates, our plan to build a new Fleek ([fleek.xyz](https://fleek.xyz)) with a new fully event-based architecture, fully modular, and extensible. A new foundation upon which Fleek could grow to offer any folder of infrastructure and development services, out of the constraints of the current platform.

Once the platform is live, **we will begin the sunsetting of Fleek.co, and full migration to the new improved platform**.

## Phases:
To be more organized we are separating the road towards sunsetting the old platform in different sequential phases that help us to ensure that the migration is up to our standards and every user has a fantastic experience leading into the new platform.

## Phase 1: Reaching Feature Parity (Current)

Before we begin a migration or transition from Fleek.co to Fleek.xyz, we need the new platform to reach feature parity with the current app and services:

### Today: Building Site Deployments, Domains, Storage, CLI/SDK

This is our **current stage** where users can interact with our SDK and CLI to store files in IPFS, deploy their sites, and configure custom domains on top of it. These services are available in early beta on Fleek.xyz.

### Next: The Release of the Beta UI for Fleek.xyz

The next phase involves releasing the beta UI of the new platform which will allow us to replicate all the features available in the CLI to the UI for those users who prefer this type of interface.  During this phase, we will be collecting feedback actively and setting the groundwork for customer support moving forward.

### Final: Full feature parity.

While we collect feedback and optimize the UI flows we will be focusing on finishing the features that are needed to complete the feature parity, out of all the missing pieces these are the two key ones:

**Git connection:** Connecting with GitHub tools to grant access to the platform to download and perform deployments directly from a repository.

**Custom Deployments:** Right now the build before the upload is being done on the users end, with this feature Fleek will collect the source code and run the build on our infrastructure controlling all the process

## Phase 2: V1 Release of the New Platform on Fleek.xyz

Once feature parity is achieved we will be releasing to the public what we will know as Fleek Platform V1, the first stable version that will run in parallel with the old platform for a small period of time. 

At this phase, we will be stopping signups on Fleek.co and offering all the user's migration tools to request to move all their relevant data to Fleek.xyz.

---

## Phase 3: Final Sunset of Fleek.co & Automatic Migration of remaining users.

After a prudent time of co-existence between the platforms and when the goals of these processes are met we will be shutting down Fleek.co and automatically migrate the missing users that didn't request them by themselves.

As we move closer to the finish line we will be sharing more information about the stages, timings and how migration details will be so stay tuned!

## FAQ: 

**Q: Can I keep building on Fleek.co, or should I wait for v1 of Fleek.xyz?**

Users can feel comfortable continuing to work and build on Fleek.co. You can continue to start and grow your project on the legacy platform, and migrate over to the new platform when available. The process will be seamless, so no disruptions would occur to projects.

**Q: Will I have a different account or lose progress/projects?**
No. The new platform is a direct replacement of the old Fleek, all users, their projects, sites, and storage, and accounts will migrate over fully.

**Q: Will Fleek.co stop its services?**

Yes, but not now and not in the short-term future. Once V1 of the new platform releases, people wonâ€™t be able to create new accounts to Fleek.co. However, existing users will be able to use the legacy service and choose to migrate over for an extended period of time. Only then we will flip the switch.
