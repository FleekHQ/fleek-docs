# File configuration

Using a .fleek.json configuration file, placed at the root of a project, you can provide options that changes the default build behavior and overrides settings from UI (except secrets).

```json
{
 "build": {
   "image": "node:alpine",
   "command": "npm install && npm run build && echo $SOME_ENV",
   "publicDir": "build",
   "baseDir": "frontend",
   "environment": {
     "SOME_ENV": "Build finished!"
   }
 }
}
```

#### All these fields are optional:

- `image` public docker image, default to node:slim
- `command` no command is executed by default
- `baseDir` build command is executed in this directory, root directory is used by default
- `publicDir` this directory is uploaded to IPFS, `baseDir` is used by default
- `environment` key/value object of environment variables

If you use `baseDir = /frontend` and `publicDir = /dist`, published path is `/frontend/dist`. If you need to publish directory above or next to your `baseDir`, you can use relative path `publicDir = ../../dist`.

### JavaScript Single Page Applications (SPA's)
Javascript SPAâ€™s generally have a build script defined in the `package.json` file. Simply set the build command to `npm install && npm run [BUILD_SCRIPT]` or `yarn && yarn [BUILD_SCRIPT]` depending on your preferred dependency manager.

You will also have to define correct `publicDir`, here's list of default configurations for popular frameworks:

<div id="framework-list">

| Framework          | Docker Image           | Build Command                       | Public Directory |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| Create React App   | fleek/create-react-app | `yarn && yarn build`                | build            |
| Gatsby             | fleek/gatsby           | `yarn && gatsby build`              | public           |
| Hugo               | fleek/hugo             | `yarn && hugo`                      | public           |
| Jekyll             | fleek/jekyll           | `jekyll build`                      | _site            |
| Next JS            | fleek/next-js          | `yarn && yarn build && yarn export` | out              |

</div>

### If you're using Gatsby

You also need to have the `gatsby-plugin-ipfs` installed and configured in your `gatsby-config` file.

# Testing builds locally

We're using docker containers to execute your builds, so you can test them locally with Docker. Here's a sample docker-compose.yml, we're using Verdaccio as a local npm proxy (it's not supported for production builds).

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  verdaccio:
    container_name: verdaccio
    image: verdaccio/verdaccio
    ports:
      - "4873:4873"

  app:
    image: $IMAGE
    command: sh -c 'npm set registry http://verdaccio:4873 && $BUILD_COMMAND'
    working_dir: /workspace/$BASE_DIR
    environment: $ENVIRONMENT
    volumes:
      - './path/to/app:/workspace/$BASE_DIR'
```

#### Building Gatsby locally

You can execute configuration below with command `docker-compose run -it --rm app`.

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  verdaccio:
    container_name: verdaccio
    image: verdaccio/verdaccio
    ports:
      - "4873:4873"

  app:
    image: fleek/gatsby
    command: sh -c 'npm set registry http://verdaccio:4873 && npm install && npm run build'
    working_dir: /workspace
    volumes:
      - './path/to/app:/workspace'
```
